I went shopping in ebay and ordered the products below from China. That was 3,50€ in total. 

- [Wired USB 2.0 to Serial RS232 CH340 Chipset 9Pin Adapter Converter Cable UU](http://www.ebay.de/itm/302180461367)
- [RJ45 Cat5 Rs232 DB9 Konverter Linksys Cisco Adapter Kabel FüR Router Kabel Neu](http://www.ebay.de/itm/142060826998)

I was already pretty sure that the RJ45 to RS232 converter had the wrong wiring. Turned out I was right. 
And the RS232 USB Adapter CH340 adapter has some serious problems on its own under linux (see next post).
